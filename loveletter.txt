Love can be expressed in a myriad of different methods, but the most timeless and most treasured will always remain the classic love letter. In a recent project here at Lovingyou.com we accepted entries for love letters from our users to reflect the current state of romance through the written word. The result is a collection of over 800 user-submitted love letters reflecting the entire range of romantic emotion! Use these letters as a starting base for your next romantic moment, or just be inspired or reflect on the romantic nature of other couples. Either way, we're sure you'll treasure these words as much as the person to whom they are written.
